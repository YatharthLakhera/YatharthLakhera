**3X Founding Engineer | Building AI-Powered Products That Scale**

I don't just build AI systems—I build products that ship fast, scale efficiently, and deliver measurable business impact. My approach: ruthless optimization, data-driven features, and zero tolerance for bloat.

## 🚀 Recent Impact

**Current: Technical Lead @ Spocto X (Yubi Company)**
- Building real-time analytics dashboard (Apache Superset-style) with LLM-powered query optimization
- Achieved **P95 latency <200ms** through lazy async caching and smart data sync
- Empowering stakeholders with self-service data insights across multiple databases

**Previous Highlights:**
- 🏗️ **Founding Member @ Amalgamic.io**: Built MVP AI Agent for Finance with multi-platform integrations (stealth mode)
- 💰 **Cost Optimization at Scale**: Slashed AWS costs by **40%** and GCP costs by **80%** at Ayu Health
- ⚡ **Performance Engineering**: Increased database performance by **10X**, deployment speed by **2X**
- 🤖 **Automation Impact**: Scaled customer support automation to reduce operational load by **50%+**

## 💡 What I Bring to the Table

**As a Founding Engineer:**
- 0→1 product development with MVP-first mindset
- Identify and eliminate bias-driven features; ship what moves metrics
- Bridge business requirements and technical execution
- Rapid prototyping with production-grade foundations

**As an AI Engineer:**
- LLM application development (LangChain, AI Agents)
- Smart cost/latency tradeoffs in production AI systems
- Multi-modal AI integration (OCR, Vision, NLP)
- Building feedback loops into AI products

**As a Technical Leader:**
- System architecture for scale and reliability
- Team leadership and technical mentorship
- Infrastructure optimization obsessive
- Data-driven decision making

## 🛠️ Tech Arsenal

**AI/ML Stack:**
- Frameworks: LangChain, AI Agents, OpenAI, Anthropic
- MLOps: Model optimization, cost management, monitoring

**Backend & Infrastructure:**
- Languages: Python, Java (Dropwizard, Guice DI)
- Cloud: AWS (Lambda, ELB, SQS, SNS, CloudWatch), GCP (Vision, OCR)
- Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis, Elasticsearch
- Monitoring: New Relic, custom observability pipelines

**Product Development:**
- No-Code/Low-Code: Bubble.io, FlutterFlow
- API Design: RESTful, FastAPI patterns
- DevOps: Docker, CI/CD pipelines, distributed systems (Redisson)

## 📊 By The Numbers

| Metric | Achievement |
|--------|-------------|
| **Cloud Cost Reduction** | 40% AWS, 80% GCP |
| **DB Performance Gain** | 10X improvement |
| **Automation Scale** | 50%+ operational load reduction |
| **Deployment Speed** | 2X faster pipelines |
| **Analytics Latency** | P95 <200ms |
| **Founding Experience** | 3X startups (Amalgamic, launch.today, Ayu Health) |

## 🎯 Case Studies

**1. Real-Time Analytics with LLM Query Builder (Spocto X)**
Challenge: Internal teams needed self-service analytics without SQL expertise
Solution: Built dashboard with LLM-powered query generation, multi-DB support, and intelligent caching
Impact: Sub-200ms P95 latency, empowered non-technical stakeholders

**2. Infrastructure Cost Optimization (Ayu Health)**
Challenge: Runaway cloud costs impacting margins
Solution: Systematically analyzed resource utilization, re-architected GCP Vision/OCR usage, optimized AWS infrastructure
Impact: $XXX,XXX annual savings (40% AWS, 80% GCP reduction)

**3. Scaling Automation for Growth (Ayu Health)**
Challenge: Customer support couldn't scale with user growth
Solution: Built intelligent automation pipelines with WhatsApp chatbot, IVR integration, and workflow optimization
Impact: 50%+ reduction in operational load, 25% call pickup improvement

## 🏆 What Sets Me Apart

- **Bias-Free Feature Development**: I kill features that don't move metrics, regardless of who suggests them
- **Speed + Quality**: Shipped production systems in weeks, not months (revamped entire backend in 30 days)
- **Full-Stack Capability**: From LLM agents to infrastructure, no-code tools to distributed systems
- **Business-First Thinking**: Every technical decision ties back to ROI and user impact
